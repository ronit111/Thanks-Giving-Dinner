# Thanks Giving Dinner

In this guided project of DataQuest, I worked with Jupyter notebook, and analyzed data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight. The dataset is stored in the thanksgiving.csv file. It contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.

The dataset has 65 columns, and 1058 rows. Most of the column names are questions, and most of the column values are string responses to the questions. Most of the columns are categorical, as a survey respondent had to select one of a few options.

Here are some potential next steps:

Figure out the most common dessert people eat.
Figure out the most common complete meal people eat.
Identify how many people work on Thanksgiving.
Find regional patterns in the dinner menus.
Find age, gender, and income based patterns in dinner menus.
